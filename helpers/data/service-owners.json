It is the largest tribunal jurisdiction within HMCTS, receiving in excess of 200,000 appeals in 2015/16. Appellants have the right to choose an oral appeal hearing and do so in around 90% of appeal hearings, requiring a network of permanent and casual hearing venues across Great Britain. The Tribunal is designed to be more informal than courts, with a more inquisitorial role and most appellants represent themselves. The service is currently fully paper based.",
