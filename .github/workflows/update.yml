      # Getting the data this way is pretty gunky, especially as github-dependents-info

      # intended to be used. We're using it to gather and analyse info where as
      # gdi was built as a documentation tool. This is especially true of the
      # github action which doesn't give us the option to output this data as
      # something like json which we can programmatically interogate.
